# Overview

This is the official template repository to generate documentation in the devices-lab style.

The upstream package for the styles and layouts is [@devices-lab/user-doc-base](https://github.com/devices-lab/user-doc-base.git) but you can override any of these by simply defining your own. If you want to get the latest changes to our styles or resources, simply update this package.

We use the excellent [eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build the static pages, and these will be placed in the `_site` folder by default, and we include a Github action to automatically build and deploy these to a Github Pages site.
